**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. It is made using responsive design. It is about all of the diverse places around the world. It contains elements of flexbox, grid layout, and media queries. So it can be accessed even from a mobile device. It contains html, css, fonts, different breakpoints for the media queries. It also contains a BEM flat file strucutre for better organization. It has psuedo classes for the buttons as well, such as hover. It has all of the awesome things you can use as a developer!

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.
